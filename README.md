# Forms In Django

Now, you can generate all the forms with ease and take different types of input from the user. 
Forms are pretty powerful elements on a webpage. They also raise many ethical questions as they contain user-data. 
Therefore, always design forms in a secure manner which are following international rules.
We have learned all the ways to validate our forms, but the last 2 are actually preferred over others.
Forms can do much more than this. 
There are different built-in forms for each task. 
Now, you can actually prepare a web-application on your own. 
Work on that, it will be fun.
